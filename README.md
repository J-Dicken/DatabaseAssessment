# DatabaseAssessment
A website for displaying information from a database based on a fictional furniture store

This was for a database module, Second year University.

All the website files have been included, however these are purely for code illustration and will not run correctly
as the database credentials have been removed.

The conceptual and logical ERDs of the database, along with the SQL files used to generate it, have also been included.
